# Title

    To-Do Application

## Objective

    To Develop a basic To-Do application using ReactJS that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. This application should showcase your understanding of HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, React components, hooks, and state management using Redux.

## Tech Stack

    Used ReactJS, Redux, CSS

## Completion Instructions

### Functionality

#### Must Have

    Frontend Development:
      * Utilize HTML to structure the application's layout.
      * Use CSS for styling the application. Feel free to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for design components.
      * Implement the application logic using JavaScript (ES6 or later).

    React Components:
      * Develop the application using functional components and demonstrate the use of React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
      * The application should have at least two components:    
          * TaskInput: A component for adding a new task.
          * TaskList: A component for displaying the list of tasks.

    State Management:  
      * Use Redux to manage the application's state. This includes storing the tasks and updating the state when adding or removing tasks.
      * Implement actions and reducers to handle the state logic.
    
    Functionality:
      * Add Task: Users should be able to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
      * View Tasks: Display all added tasks in a list format.
      * Delete Task: Each task should have a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
      
    Edit Task: 
      * Each task should have an edit button that, when clicked, task popup opens from the list.

#### Nice to Have

    * Add the capability to mark tasks as completed without deleting them. This could involve toggling the task's state and styling.
    * Implement persistent storage (e.g., saving tasks to local storage) so that tasks are not lost on page reload.


### Guidelines to develop a project

#### Must Have

    * Create a new public repository on GitHub for the assignment.
    * Commit your code regularly and include clear commit messages.
    * Include a README file explaining the project setup, usage instructions, and any additional information.
    * Ensure the repository is well-organized and easy to navigate.
